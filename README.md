## Coming back to this
5/21: Got totally whammied by this fever/lingering cough/weird breathing thing, apparently gotta get an x-ray of my chest? Anyway, I'll finish this once I'm healthier.

5/22: x-ray is good! No pneumonia, just asthma. Making progress on this locally, front end's a mess though.

To Do: 
- make a function to make card elements for the comments (including a button to delete comments)
- delete comments from db
- deploy to heroku
